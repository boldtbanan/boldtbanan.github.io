If you've read any business publications since 2020, you've probably seen articles about how all your workers are exhausted. The last one to pop up for me was [An Exhausting Year in (and Out of) the Office](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2023-in-review/an-exhausting-year-in-and-out-of-the-office) by Cal Newport in the New Yorker. It's a good read, and Cal has some well-researched points, but these articles always leave me feeling a bit cheated. It's the same way I feel after reading most management books - like I'm only getting the part of the story that you want to tell and not the whole messy truth.

In my current life as a management consultant, I go into organizations where people are burning out. I've seen _a lot_ of exhausted people. But my job is to fix organizations, so I get to dig into why things are broken. Honestly, I'm not going to give you the entire truth in this post either, but I hope to give you a better idea of the complexity underpinning it all.

## Always-on communication and expectations of availability

The main factor that the New Yorker article gets right is the proliferation of digital communication tools. But this trend has been coming since well before the pandemic. Slack launched in 2013. Microsoft Teams was released in 2017. Zoom debuted in 2012. That doesn't even cover all the precursor products/protocols to these are even older (e.g. Skype - 2003, Webex - 1995, IRC - 1988, Conference calls - 1915). Sure, usage exploded during the pandemic as people had no choice but to do all of their work remotely, but outsourcing and multi-office companies always have made these tools indespensible for getting work done. Even with the push to get people back in offices, most people spend a large part of their day on virtual meetings working with colleagues in other buildings, states or countries anyway. What's missing from the article is _why_ digital tool use is such a problem, and that has to do more with cultural expectations than the tools themselves.

Most of the tools we use have a long history, but that history (more often than not), looks something like

1. Someone creates a thing to use/sell in business
2. People see it and say "Hey, I can use that for fun stuff too!"
3. These new "fun" patterns get re-adopted by business (either by copying or younger workers bringing their usage patterns into the office)
4. Repeat steps 2-3 ad infinitum

Take [instant messaging](https://www.britannica.com/topic/instant-messaging) for example. The cycle for that looks something like:

1. Created in 1971 for the Office of Emergency Preparedness to help exchange information within the U.S. government, allowing coordination during emergencies
2. A bunch of intermediate steps (BBS, IRC, etc) bouncing between business/consumer leading to AOL Instant Messenger which, combined with the explosion of personal internet use, led to broad social adoption of instant messaging
3. Everyone gets cell phones, and hey, you can text (i.e. instant message) on those
4. More intermediate steps (iPhone - your phone does cool stuff and looks cool doing it)
5. ...and now you're here, where we have a business tool, instant messaging, that everyone uses in their personal life

So you have these tools which sort of resemble the back and forth of in-person conversation. And with BYOD policies, your personal device (phone, laptop, tablet) has become your work device so the habits carry over, creating a set of expectations:

* You can be reached (and don't mind being reached) at any time of day. After all, we're all friends here. Who doesn't like talking to their friends?
* Sending any random thought as soon as you have it is ok, because that's how conversation works with your friends.

On top of that, layer business stress:

* Money is on the line. Every second you don't respond is flushing money down the toilet. Time is money!
* This is important to me right now, and I'm the boss, so it should be important to you right now. You aren't responding instantly so you must be ignoring me. I know your phone is in your hand or in your pocket. Pay attention to me!

The expectation of always-on availability has become such an issue that Australia recently passed [the Fair Work Amendment (Right to Disconnect)](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6982), setting limits on what communication is reasonable outside of normal working hours. Australia's new rules follow similar legislation in France, Germany, Ireland, and a handfull of other countries. 

While right to disconnect hasn't gained traction in the US (which generally favors flexibility in employee/employer communication arrangements over strict rules), a [2022 survey by Skynova](https://www.skynova.com/blog/after-hours-communication) showed that 63% of US employees think it should be illegal for employers to contact them outside of working hours. Only 15% of of respondents said that contact outside of regular work hours happened less than a few times per month. Taken together, those statiscs highlight the unsustainable situation we're in with communication.

[placeholder for Veruca Salt I want it now image]

Fortunately, workers value (and [studies show the net benefit](https://www.upf.edu/documents/3885005/140470042/11.Messenger.pdf/97d66c02-0edf-5fd8-2b29-7300017d47c0)) of work arrangements that allow for remote work and time-shifting work outside of normal work hours. So it's not just that communication happens, but that there aren't consistent expectations around how and when that communication is ok. That the [lack of consistent expectations leads to higher anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420739/) shouldn't be a surprise, but when you're dealing with a stressful work situation, you're less likely to think about how your actions (reaching out to someone else outside of work hours) will impact them, or the cumulative effect that has over time as it increases chaos in employee lives around the clock. Establishing company guidelines, and sticking to them, around communication approaches can significantly help reduce the stress from this area. The New Yorker article has some great ideas there too:

* Use email for broadcasting non-urgent information or things that can be resolved with a single reply
* Establishing office hours to constrain interruptions to a window of time
* Get used to waiting for a response. Make it a key point of your culture that immediacy is reserved for rare instance, and be clear about what those are and have those channels be different than the normal communication channels

## Hustle culture

The late 2000s saw the explosion of [hustle culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html) coinciding with the rise of influencers on social media and a new wave of tech startups funded by low interest rates in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Partly a reaction to 90/00s slacker culture (which was a reaction to 80s yuppie culture, which was a reaction to 60s/70s hippie culture, etc...), hustle culture preaches the need to always be "hustling" to do more, because you can do always do more. It's the business version of a Nike ad 

[Fake Nike commercial]

It seems like an easy mental leap that working more hours equates to more production. Yet [studies](https://docs.iza.org/dp8129.pdf) [continually](https://slack.com/blog/news/the-surprising-connection-between-after-hours-work-and-decreased-productivity) [show](https://docs.iza.org/dp10722.pdf) a decline in productivity a threshold of hours worked. With physical work, you see a spike in mistakes leading to injury. With knowledge work, where the risk of workplace injury is very low, the negative effects are subtler: mistakes, chronic health issues and an overall reduction in the rate of productivity across all hours worked. In other words, hour 10 of a chronic 60 hour work week is less productive than hour 10 of a consistent 40 hour work week.

These are lessons that we learned 80 years ago. The 40 hour work week is a result of data that showed (in industrial times) that, for a sustained level (i.e. hours) of effort, additional hours spent did not result in an overall increase in output. So why do we still have people saying things like:

> "'Could you work 130 hours in a week?'
> The answer is yes, if you're strategic about when you sleep, when you shower, and how often you go to the bathroom." ~ Marissa Mayer

When people say stupid things like this, they're performing. In the same way trash-talking professional fighters try to psych out the competition, these folks are claiming to be better at working than everybody else. Still, we want to believe what they're saying because it feels true. In the short term, bursts of work _do_ allow us to finish more. Every extra hour you work allows you to accomplish more than if you just stopped where you are and didn't do anything else. But if you don't take enough time between work to recover, the next hour back isn't as productive as it would have been. This effect compounds the more it happens, to the point where [after 8 consecutive 60 hour weeks, you will have delivered no more value than if you had worked 40 hour weeks over the same time period](https://www.scribd.com/document/75599238/Calculating-Loss-of-Productivity-Due-to-OT-Using-Charts-Nov-2001). 

We've had a decade of performative workaholism encouraging people to work longer and harder without any corresponding spike in productivity. They've been sprinting hard for little to no gain, so of course people are tired. After all, the guy who (as legend has it) ran from Marathon to Athens to bring news of victory [died after he delivered his message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheidippides).

## Collaborate everywhere, all the time

In the mid-2010s, it seemed like every manager read [Creativity, Inc.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc). Ed Catmull's account of building culture at Pixar struck a nerve in a corporate America that was already reacting to cultural changes diffusing out of a startup scene that stressed collaborative leadership strategies over management by edict. Cubicles were torn down and replaced with open caverns of unassigned desks so workers could (theoretically) sit with the people they needed to collaborate with that day.

I'm a huge fan of collaboration. I think it works amazingly well to forge great ideas from good ideas if you have a skilled team working together. But what unfolded across most of these companies wasn't a culture of collaboration - it was a culture of consensus.

[Most people don't know how to collaborate effectively]. Good collaboration requires fresh associations: new combinations of perspectives that bring a diverity of thought together to uncover novel solutions. Bringing different viewpoints together naturally leads to conflict. To make that conflict productive, teams need to understand how to engage in purposeful conversations and come to decisions that allow it to move foward rather than spin in chaos.

Walking the line to harness productive conflict is a skill. Without actively developing the right techniques, many teams aren't able to strike the right balance. Some lean too far toward decisiveness and that shuts down discussion, turning workers into drones that want to be told what to do. Others over-stress agreement, leading to consensus-driven cultures that have difficulty ever coming to a decision. 

One of my favorite tools to manage collaboration is [fist to five](https://fireflies.ai/blog/fist-to-five) voting. It allows people to express levels of disagreement with an idea or approach, which helps them avoid getting stuck in an endless discussion loop over minor details. Usually, that's also enough keep them in a productive zone between command-and-control and quagmire.

But collaboration is stressful, and most people will naturally gravitate toward working with homogenous groups that reduce conflict (but also ideation). 

Susan Cain published [Quiet: The power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/8520610) in 2012, a couple years before Creativity, Inc. (The related [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts) gives you a great overview). In it, she lays out physiological factors for introversion/extroversion. The oversimplified version is that introverts receive far more sensory stimulation from an environment, which leads to stress responses when they are overstimulated. Extroverts seek out (and create) extra stimulation to meet a baseline need, because they feel stress from understimulation. Neither is better or worse (I highly recommend you read the book), but it provides a needed perspective on work environments as stimulas factories.

Collaboration is a highly-stimulative experience. So are open work plans. So right as organizations began pushing for more stimulative interactions, they were removing all the quiet spaces for people to recover from those interactions. 

[Between 1990 and 2020, the average office space square footage per employee was cut by 65%](https://www.brookfield.com/news-insights/insights/future-office-not-what-you-might-think). That figure includes common-spaces (meeting rooms, hallways, bathrooms, break rooms, etc.), meaning personal space has reduced even further. The trend has reversed a little bit in the last couple of years as employers try to entice workers to come back in person, but mostly in communal areas that look good in a brochure.

Many workers responded to the collaboration and space stress by suffering through the day and time-shifting focused work into evenings. The number of times I've heard someone say "I do my actual job at night, after all the distractions I have all day," has increased dramatically in the last 15 years. That's unsustainable.

Collaboration is important. It can produce better results, and get to better solutions faster. But focused time is where gets done. That's a balance to strike that changes over time - when do you need to explore solutions (collaborate) and when do you need to execute on solutions? Creating an environment that has the right mix of both spaces is crucial. 

The pendulum has swung too far toward collaboration spaces and away from focus spaces. You can see that in the resistance to go back to the office and in studies that show, for many cases, [remote work has little aggregate effect on productivity](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2024/01/does-working-from-home-boost-productivity-growth/), either positive or negative (caveat: there may be some small, but statistically significant, [negative impacts for inexperienced workers in some fields](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1061.pdf?sc_lang=en), but those are offset by reduced real estate costs).

The way I look at it, we're about 4 years into figuring out how to work

I'm tired of talking about remote work. I'm tired of reading articles like [this](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2023-in-review/an-exhausting-year-in-and-out-of-the-office) about how digital communication is the thing that's burning everyone out. They're not wrong, but it's not the full story.  

As a consultant, I'm brought in to organizations where people are burning out and it's a mess. So I've seen a lot of tired people.

One thing the New Yorker article nails is the impact of always-on communication and expectations of availability. Enabled by a wave of technology changes over the last 30 years, we've turned into a society of Veruca Salts. But when everyone is Veruca Salt, everyone is also 

- Always-on communication/availability
  - New Yorker article gets it right
  - Business tools, adopted for personal use, coopted for business use with the expectations of personal availability
  - Didn't start with the pandemic
  - Work time happened at work
  - Changing job expectations - the internet doesn't sleep - you never really leave work
  - Attention economy (and service work) runs hot off normal working hours
  - Veruca Salt - I want it now
- Hustle culture
  - Reaction to the 90s slacker culture (just like the 80s were a reaction to the 60s/70s)
  - People get mad if you don't respond immediately
  - Coincides with rise of influencers/social media/growth hacking
  - Reward hero culture
  - Hero culture is an overall negative impact and leads to arsonists
  - You have a laptop, I expect you to work anywhere
- Virtual meetings
  - Had a break
  - Harder to read people
- Push for "collaborate everywhere, all the time" and consensus-driven work
  - Not how innovation works (evidence?)
  - Politics is hard, and it's getting harder
  - People never learn how to collaborate - group projects where one person does all the work
    - Going for consensus instead of consent
    - Sometimes, who cares? Where can we just make a decision?
  - Organizations don't know how to hire/build teams for effective collaboration
  - Super chickens
  - Too many accidental diminishers
  - No privacy - overwhelming for introverts
  - Susan Cain - Quiet
  - 
- Severe reduction in space per employee. with open office plans and "hot-desking" becoming the norm
  - Square footage reduction: https://www.brookfield.com/news-insights/insights/future-office-not-what-you-might-think
  - Often meant well - to introduce collaboration
  - Like everyone read Creativity, Inc. without understanding the need for different spaces with different purposes
  - No place to call your own
  - Like you're a travelling salesperson, even when you go into the same office
  - Matrix people in pods
  - Less interaction (citation?) in open office plans than not
  - 
- The hyper-fragmentation of roles (you are the person who does this tiny slice of a solution and never get to see the big picture)
  - Nobody has the big picture, so delivering anything has mountains of miscommunication
  - The amount of domain knowlege needed to come up with a solution is unreasonable
  - Schooling and interest drive depth/specialization over generalization
  - HR/hiring data encourages hyperspecialization
    - When you really need a specialist, you need deep knowledge of an area
    - That level of depth is rare
    - Mostly, you don't actually need that depth, you need depth in making multiple parts work together
    - That experience is harder to measure/communicate and has a lower barrier to claim experience
    - Looks like there is a larger pool of talent
    - Market for lemons - reduced price
    - Reinforces hyper specialization as a career path (until you reach a dead-end in a technology)
  - We need better abstractions
  - Latest fad is to expect AI to solve that for you because it can think better or faster than your "dumb" employees
  - https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/the-science-behind-the-growing-importance-of-collaboration
  - 
- Endless stream of management fad-chasing and fear-mongering based on biases, not data (note the RTO, quiet quitting, etc. that the author mentions)
  - Rage-mining and fear-mining content farms
  - RTO policy enforcement is highly correlated with pay imbalance (citation?)
  - Methodology chasing - Agile, SAFe
  - 
- The meta game
  - What it takes to be successful changes frequently
  - Hyper-competitive strategies 
  - Stress rises in a chaotic environment
  - Gervaise principle (sociopaths)
  - Sociopaths are able to simplify the rules and take short cuts
  -
- The good news
  - From what I see, people aren't nearly as exhausted as all the breakthless articles claim
  - Mostly people want the standard drivers, Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose and Relatedness
  - Work is work. It's great if you enjoy it. It's great if you're doing your passion. But don't give me that bullshit about "I've never worked a day in my life because I love what I do." Some days it feels like work, and when your livelihood depends on it, that gets all tangled up for most people.
  












I think the exhaustion it talks about is happening, but not to the extent that it implies. I also think it takes an overly narrow view on the issue, completely missing a lot of other contributing factors which started well before the pandemic:

- Always-on communication/availability
- Severe reduction in space per employee. with open office plans and "hot-desking" becoming the norm
- Push for "collaborate everywhere, all the time" and consensus-driven work
- Endless stream of management fad-chasing and fear-mongering based on biases, not data (note the RTO, quiet quitting, etc. that the author mentions)
- The hyper-fragmentation of roles (you are the person who does this tiny slice of a solution and never get to see the big picture)

I'm sure I could come up with more, but more than anything it seems like it's the increased pace of change in how work gets done that prevents people from ever settling into a routine.
