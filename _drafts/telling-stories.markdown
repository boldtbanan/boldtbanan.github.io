User stories are the backbone of agile's todo-list-driven development model. Whether you use kanban, scrum, xp, or any hybrid, user stories are the basis for communicating what you want to build to the people who will build it.

##What's in a story?

Most training on user stories tells you to write something like this:

**As a [user role] I can [activity] so that [business value].**

That's a powerful structure. It puts focus on your users and what they are trying to accomplish by using the feature you want to build. It narrows focus to a manageable piece of work that should be (relatively) easy to complete. 

And it's completely inadequate.

I'm not going to get into what it takes to turn a user story into a real spec. There is plenty written on that all over the internet.

What I want to talk about is what user stories are good for, and why you should spend more time on them than you do.

User stories are the main tool a Product Owner has for flow control. They are your way to decide what pieces of a system are the most important and which should be worked on first. This is hugely important when you start considering minimum viable product, and working to deliver value early. What are the tasks to add value? Do you really need validation at this time, or can you add that after you launch? Do you need to handle 5 different OAuth providers, or is one sufficient for now, and which one?  

User stories are the breadcrumb trail to minimum viable product.
Don't talk about infrastructure in the story.

##How do you manage flow?

The way you break down stories defines how much control you have over your flow. 

* Story arcs
* Iterative value
* Communicate intent, not action
* User stories are iterative

Stories are promises to have a conversation about a problem. 



##Story arcs

##Understand your audience

User stories are targeted to a user role, but you need more than that, and you need to communicate that to the team.

* Is this a checkbox feature (need it to check a box on buying requirements) for a buyer?
* Will someone run into this 10% of the time, or 100%. Will it save them 1 minute or 2 days?
* How big is the potential market? How influential are they within their organization?
* 

##It's a creative process

Play with your stories. Move them around. Break them down in different ways. Try to package the most value in the minimum amount of effort. Have an idea for how much effort it takes. That's why Product Owners need to estimate with the team, to internalize a gut feeling for how much it costs to build things.

Stories are really cheap to write. It's one sentence. Use that low cost to come up with multiple plans for implementing larger features and see which fits best. Run your ideas by the team, but come prepared.

There is no "right" answer. Take your best guess, but measure the impact and adapt to new knowledge.



Like an actor: what's my motivation



- Value of user stories to product owners

- How to write a good story?
- How to create the right slices
- How to identify all of the stories
- What stories are useful for

##Choose your own adventure

##Think backwards

Sometimes it's better to do the last step first. For example:

List of orders (with sorting, filtering, etc).
View an order
Store orders in the database
